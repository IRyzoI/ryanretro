Lunar Eternal Blue Classic plays the FMVs without issues, but there are frame dips from 60 to 40 from the start when moving around. After the first boot it started exhibiting the issues that described next. Lunar Eternal Blue Remastered does not boot FMVs and gets stuck at the first in-game cutscene so I could not test in-game performance and is unplayable. I cannot recommend playing Lunar Eternal Blue on the RP5 at the current state with this configuration.",2025/4/20,Retroid Pocket 5

1.
Handheld mode, 1x resolution
This is the most stable setting, but is only 720p and has a 7-chunk render distance. Perfect 60fps, extremely rarely freezes (but there is auto-save every minute or so, so don't worry).

2. Docked mode, 0.75x resolution.
Less stable, but gives a 810p resolution (not a typo, it is actually 810p) and has a 10-chunk render distance. Gameplay is almost always at 60fps, with rare dips to 55 or so. Freezes are infrequent, but not impossible.

3. Docked mode, 1x resolution.
The least stable, but most impressive graphics. 1080p and 10-chunk render distance. Performance is also almost always at 60fps, but freezes are pretty common, maybe every 10-15 minutes or so.
