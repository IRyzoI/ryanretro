It runs perfectly in the beginning, but once I got outside, I couldn't move without wiggling the stick. I had to look up why it was happening and its because of the performance settings. If you have it on Performance in the container settings, you get stuck as well as npcs; intermediate you can move but frames drop below 30fps.

Go to Settings in the Winlator menu and clone the Performance settings, then disable Box64_Dynarec_CallRet. Performance is now amazing and no issues.

Graphics driver version doesn't appear to be very important.
DX Wrapper must be DXVK versions 1.10.3 or less, anything newer will cause a DirectX error.
Any version of Box64 seems to work, I use 0.3.2.
Set box64 preset to performance for better fps.

If the game doesn't run for you, try these steps in this order:
1. In the Winlator settings for your game's shortcut, open the Advanced tab and scroll down to ""Exec Arguments."" Put in ""/failsafe"" without the quotes. If the game boots up, remember to remove this arg before next launch.
2. In your container's start menu look for a DirectX 2010 installer (in Frost it's in Start &gt; Install &gt; Install DX June 2010)
3. Install the Visual C++ Redistributable 2010 (some versions of Winlator have an installer in the start menu, otherwise download from Microsoft.)
